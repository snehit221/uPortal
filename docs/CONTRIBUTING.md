# Guidelines for Contributing

Contributions from the community are essential in keeping uPortal (any Open Source project really) strong and successful.  While we try to keep requirements for contributing to a minimum, there are a few guidelines we ask that you mind.

## Most importantly

If you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You
won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely
asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules
to get in the way of that.

However, for those individuals who want a bit more guidance on the best way to contribute to the
project, read on. This document will cover what we're looking for. By addressing all the points
we're looking for, it raises the chances we can quickly merge or address your contributions.

## Individual Contributor License Agreement

uPortal is an Apereo project.  Apereo requires that contributions be through Individual Contributor License Agreements.  If you wish to make a contribution, you must complete an Individual Contributor License Agreement.  It is through this agreement that you are licensing your contribution to Apereo so that Apereo can then license it to others under uPortal's open source software license.

You can learn more about [Apereo licensing generally][], the [contributor licensing agreements specifically][], and get the actual [Individual Contributor License Agreement form][], as linked.


## Apereo Welcoming Policy

As an Apereo project, participation in uPortal is within the scope of the Apereo Welcoming Policy. cf. [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`][] at the root of this repository.


## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with Git, GitHub and/or contributing to uPortal via GitHub there are a few pre-requisite steps.

*   Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
*   [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo) the uPortal repository.  As discussed in the linked page, this also includes:
    *   [Set](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) up your local git install
    *   Clone your fork


## Communicate first and often

What contribution are you looking to make?  Whom will this benefit?  Would anyone like to know what you're doing? Can anyone help you design and scope your contribution?  Who can validate that it meets the need?

Your potential bugfix or improvement or new feature should be represented by a GitHub issue in.  (You'll also need this GitHub issue number in your topic branch name and in your commit messages, below.)

You should probably post on [uportal-dev@][] signaling your intentions and inviting early input and feedback.

Perhaps uPortal adopters on [uportal-user@][] will be interested in helping to validate requirements and design?

You may be able to find others to collaborate with for mutual benefit.


## Create the working (topic) branch

Create a "topic" branch on which you will work.  The convention is to name the branch using the GitHub issue number.  If there is not already a GitHub issue covering the work you want to do, create one.  Assuming you will be working from the master branch and working on the GitHub issue `#42`:

```shell
git checkout -b GH-42 master
```

For a more in-depth description of the git workflow check out the
[uPortal Git Workflow](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/UPC/Git+Workflow+for+Non-Committers)


## Code

*   Apply uPortal [code conventions][] and [architecture][].
*   Write automated unit tests exercising existing code you are touching and exercising your new code.  If you are fixing a bug, first write a unit test demonstrating the bug so as to stave off future regression.

uPortal uses [Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Java code style][AOSP Java style].

[You can][google-java-format-gradle-plugin_quickstart] check Java style with `./gradlew verGJF`,
and format Java files with `./gradlew goJF`.

## Collaborate

Consider pushing your changes to a topic branch in your (public) fork of the repository continually as you work, so that others can see what you are doing and can engage with you on it.  Consider commenting on the GitHub issue and/or on the [uportal-dev@][] email thread letting folks know this branch is available for collaboration.


## Commit

*   Make commits of logical units.
*   Be sure to use the GitHub issue key in the commit message.  This is how GitHub will pick up the related commits and display them on the GitHub issue.
*   Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
*   Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

_Prior to committing, if you want to pull in the latest upstream changes  (highly appreciated btw), please use [rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) rather than merging.  Merging creates "merge commits" that really muck up the project timeline._


## Test

If your changes are not user-facing, consider writing unit tests. To run unit tests use:

```shell
./gradlew check
```

If your change is to a user-facing experience, it should not regress support for [supported browser versions](SUPPORTED_BROWSERS.md).


## Submit

*   You submitted a [Contributor License Agreement][], right?  Seriously, Apereo cannot accept your contribution other than under a Contributor License Agreement.
*   Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
*   Initiate a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).  Name the Pull Request prefixed with the issue identifier (e.g., "UP-4148 Update contributing guidance").  Mention and link the GitHub issue in the first couple lines of your Pull Request description so it's very convenient for reviewers to get to the GitHub issue from your pull request.  Use the pull request as another opportunity to communicate effectively about what is being changed.  Can your change be shown in before and after screenshots?  Did you make interesting implementation decisions or tradeoffs?
*   Update the GitHub issue, adding a comment including a link to the created pull request.  If the problem or improvement came to be better understood through implementation, update the description and add comments to communicate what was learned.  A release engineer will rely upon the GitHub to summarize release notes for the release including your change and those release notes will link to the GitHub issue, so the GitHub issue as a good place to communicate clearly about _what_ was changed _why_ and _how_.
