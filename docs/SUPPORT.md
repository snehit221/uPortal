# Got a Question or Problem?

Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on the [uPortal mailing list][].

The [uPortal mailing list][] is a much better place to ask questions since:

* there are lots of people willing to help on the mailing list
* questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else

To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to the [uPortal mailing list][].
